## Description
The goal of this project is to showcase what we learned during the Angular courses we had.
The requierements were : 
1. Use an API (We picked [Covid19](https://covid19api.com))
2. Have a beautiful UI (We used [Material](https://material.angular.io))

## Dependencies
 - Angular CLI
    ```
    npm install
    ``` 
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en).

## How to use it
First you need to download the project :
```
git clone https://github.com/PDesoomer/Covipi
```

Then you go into the directoy :
```
cd Covipi
```

After that you launch the ```angular server```:
```
ng serve 
```
You need to wait a bit, depending on the hardware you are running the server on, it might takes few minutes.

Meanwhile you can go to ```http://localhost:4200/``` where the server will be running.
